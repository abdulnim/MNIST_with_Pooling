# Pooling-Only Neural Network on MNIST

In this small code, I experimented with a unique network architecture that only uses pooling layers, followed by a single fully connected (FC) layer. Surprisingly, this simple model achieved a commendable **<span style="color: green;">83% accuracy</span>** on the MNIST dataset in just 5 epochs. Dive in to explore the code and insights!
